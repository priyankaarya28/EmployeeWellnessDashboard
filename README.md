# employeeWellnessDashboard
This Employee Wellness Dashboard is a simple web-based interface that helps employees track their daily wellness activities, such as steps taken and water intake.

HTML: Structures the dashboard with headings, stats, and a button.
CSS: Styles the dashboard with a clean, modern look, including a responsive layout and vibrant colors.
JavaScript: Updates the wellness statistics dynamically when the user clicks the "Update Stats" button, simulating real-time tracking.
This project serves as a foundation for a more advanced wellness tracking system with potential integrations like APIs, user authentication, and data persistence. ðŸš€
